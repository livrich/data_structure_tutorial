# Data Structure Tutorial

Welcome to the Data Structure Tutorial. All examples and practice problems will be implemented using Python. This is not a comprehensive tutorial of all data structures. The following three data structures will be covered:
* [Stack](stack.md)
* [Set](set.md)
* [Tree](tree.md)

Each module will contain descriptions and examples. At the end of each module, there is a problem to solve on your own. For the best practice, you should attempt to solve the problem before looking at the solution.
